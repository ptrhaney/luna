The idea of Lunatectonics disappeared altogether with Wegener&#39;s untimely death in 1930 in Greenland and because of early misunderstandings on the structure of the Earth. In the early 20th century all geologists believed that there was an underlying basement membrane covering the entire Earth and that for the continents to move, they would have to be &quot;unleashed from their moorings and plow through the membrane.&quot; </span><span class="c18">2</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; With the discovery of seafloor spreading and the Mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mountain system in the 1960&#39;s, the idea of the Earth having a basement membrane was shown to be incorrect. Continental rock (granite) and ocean floor rock (basalt) are the two different types of rock that are Earth&#39;s lithosphere. No basement membrane exists beneath either of them. The lithosphere is the constantly changing relationship between these two types of rock and how they work together to create Earth&#39;s outer shell. Continental granite rock is less dense at 3.0 gm per cm, making up 40% of the Earth&#39;s surface area but 70% of the lithosphere&#39;s total mass. Seafloor basalt is denser at 3.4 gm/cm, comprising 60% of the Earth&#39;s surface area but only 30% of the lithosphere&#39;s mass.</span></p><a id="t.a88461b39e66dfed495579ae54c92c8e89c8b670"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c2"><td class="c14" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Density</span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">% of lithosphere mass</span></p></td><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">% of lithosphere surface area</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c2"><td class="c14" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Continental granite</span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">2.8-3.0 gm/cm</span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;70%</span></p></td><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40%</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c2"><td class="c14" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Seafloor basalt</span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">3.2-3.4 gm/cm</span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30%</span></p></td><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60%</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In the 1920&#39;s through the 1960&#39;s it was felt that the seafloor basalt was too strong to permit lateral movement of the continents, the opposite turns out to be true. Today it is clear that the continents are the building blocks of the lithosphere with the seafloor adapting to the drift of the continents. The seafloor fills in the areas vacated by continental drift, or in the case of the Pacific ocean, closing and becoming smaller as the Asian and North American plates drift towards each other. The closing of the Pacific ocean creates the ring of fire where the Pacific seafloor is being consumed. Geologists complained that continental drift does not provide for how the continents move. It has been more than 100 years since Alfred Wegener first proposed it and geologists still have no mechanism today for how the continents move.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>As continents drift apart and create new oceans as in the case of the Red Sea today, a mid-ocean ridge develops to heal the wound created in the Earth&#39;s crust by the separating continents. With the passage of eons, oceans mature, i.e. the Atlantic ocean, and eventually begin to close, as in the case of the Pacific ocean today. When oceans begin to close the seafloor is compressed to the point of rupture at its weakest area, the passive margins or the original union of seafloor ocean basalt with continental crust. This explains how ophiolites are inverted or obducted onto continental shelves and how seafloor is then compelled to descend into the upper mantle as the oceans close. Seafloor that was created at MORB is then consumed by the Earth at what are known as active margins. In a very real sense the Earth&#39;s seafloor evolves to be an Ouroboro. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 267.10px; height: 143.05px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 267.10px; height: 143.05px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c20">&quot;</span><span class="c20">In his work, Timaeus, Plato refers to the ouroboros as the first living creature in existence. As the first, it was the most perfect because of its self-sufficiency. The ouroboros had no eyes because outside itself there was nothing to be seen. It had no ears because there was nothing outside itself to listen to. This creature was a self-eating and circular being. Despite of its self-eating nature, however, it had no organs that would allow it to digest for there was nothing that could come into its system that existed outside of itself. It also lacked the ability to breathe for similar reasons. The only one of the senses that this creature was given was the ability to move and writhe in it&rsquo;s circular nature that represented the essence of its being. This story is often referred to by those who reflect on the mysteries of the ouroboros in modern day.&quot; </span><span class="c20 c18">3 </span><span class="c20 c21">&nbsp;What Plato did not say in describing ouroboros as the first living creature in existence is that it was the Earth itself. (In memory of D L Anderson)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Mid-ocean Ridge Basalt mountain system and Seafloor spreading.</span></p><p class="c9"><span>Seafloor spreading at a constant rate over millions of years requires a clock-like anchor mechanism to regulate the seafloor spreading. No such regulating mechanism has been described in the plate tectonics mantle convection hypothesis. As the only thing constant with the Earth is change, to produce the systematic controlled seafloor spreading for 100&#39;s of millions of years can only occur by a force from outside the Earth. Carlos Doglioni and </span><span class="c8">Giuliano Panza</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;call this astronomical tuning in Polarized Plate Tectonics. The earth-tides &nbsp;produced by the moon/sun interactions for the past billions of years account for the constant rate of seafloor spreading and answer why some spreading centers produce seafloor at higher rates than others. The fact that MORB&#39;s with descending seafloors at the periphery are faster than plates with only passive margins demonstrates that the driving mechanism of seafloor spreading originates at the MORB mountain ranges and not at the descending zones as characterized by mantle convection plate tectonics. It is a well known fact that many areas of descending seafloor, aka subducting slabs, move at slower rates than the spreading seafloor connected to those descending areas, ergo slab subduction cannot be the driving force or engine of plate tectonics.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">It was Sir Harold Jeffreys who stated that should the lunar force be the cause of continental drift, it would have to be strong enough that it would stop the Earth&#39;s rotation within several million years. This was during the epoch where geologists thought there was a basement membrane that would require the continents to be unleashed from their moorings and to plow through a basement membrane. As noted previously, this is in error. But credit should also be given to Sir Jeffreys for recognizing the work of George Darwin, grandson of Sir Charles Darwin. George Darwin noted that should the moon ever have been closer then its effects would have been pronounced as the vorticical force is equal to the 6th power of the distance of the moon. Thus when the moon was 1/10th its current distance 4 bya, the mixing force of the moon would have been 1,000,000 times stronger than it is today. Even 500 mya when the moon was 1/2 its current distance, the mixing force would have been 64 times greater than today.

Astrophysicists have assessed every aspect of the differences between the two planets except in reflecting on what Earth&#39;s moon has impacted on Earth&#39;s during 4.5 billion years. A recent paper of Oct/21, (</span><span class="c17"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.unige.ch/communication/communiques/en/2021/y-a-t-il-eu-des-oceans-sur-venus/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1635768537037000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2R1QAa1UNR30xdTHOGCulL">https://www.unige.ch/communication/communiques/en/2021/y-a-t-il-eu-des-oceans-sur-venus/</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;) &nbsp; relates how the two planets evolved differently, yet with nary a mention of the moon. Geologists like to state that mantle convection is inferred because the plates are organized and move, and the only force taken into account is from within the Earth. A stronger inference is made in that the Earth is the only known planet with &quot;plate tectonics&quot; and it is the only known planet to have a sizable moon. Lunatectonics goes beyond inference in that the steady rate of seafloor spreading can only be explained by a force outside of the Earth.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">1.) &nbsp;Alfred Wegener: (1922).

The displacement within Earth&#39;s upper mantle by the continental roots and the descending seafloor lithosphere is mirrored and creates the MORB. The MORB is the anti-roots to Earth&#39;s continental roots and the descending seafloor.
